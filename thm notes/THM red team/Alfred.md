system is blatantly running a webservice on an alt port 8080

nmap doesnt tell me about any reverse shells on 8080 so we had to try logging in

***unfortunately I navigated to the 10.10.60.95:8080/robots.txt file but didnt check the main page 10.10.60.95:8080 to see it was hosting jenkins

***the first flag was solved by googling the default uname and password for jenkins lol

***next we were instructed using nishang was a good idea so I put it on my desktop and hosted an http server in that directory to access the exploits

sudo ufw allow 8181
sudo ufw allow 4444

started TCP handler for meterpreter

once in the challenge has you find a flag in the system

use incognito 

list_tokens -g

which shows the impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"  is available

 run the desired process such as the flag by migrating to a priviledged process

for example with "tasklist"

 find the PID of spooler and just

migrate 1219 

which enables me to migrate to the spooler service and then you can just 

cat C:\Windows\System32\config\root.txt

rooted the system PWNed
